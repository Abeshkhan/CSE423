    "The question in the document is asking you to implement the Mid-point line algorithm to draw the last two digits of your ID, which in your case are '78'. The algorithm should be able to work for any ID, meaning it should be able to draw any two-digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mid-point line algorithm is a computer graphics algorithm for rendering lines. It uses only integer addition and subtraction, making it faster than algorithms that use floating-point arithmetic. The algorithm works by calculating the mid-point between two potential pixels and choosing the one that is closest to the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can solve this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Mid-point Line Algorithm: The Mid-point line algorithm works by calculating the mid-point between two potential pixels and choosing the one that is closest to the line. The algorithm starts with the leftmost point and moves to the right, at each step deciding whether to put the next pixel above or below the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the Zone: The document mentions that a line can be in any one of the 8 zones. You need to determine in which zone the given coordinates are. This can be done using the FindZone function mentioned in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting to Zone-0: Once you know the zone, you need to convert the coordinates of any zone to the coordinates of Zone-0. This is done because the Mid-point line algorithm is implemented for Zone-0 in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Mid-point Line Algorithm: After converting the coordinates to Zone-0, you can run the Mid-point line algorithm to calculate the intermediate points. This is done using the DrawLine function mentioned in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting Back to Original Zone: Before drawing the pixels, you need to convert them back to their original zone. This is done because you want to draw the line in the original zone, not in Zone-0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing the Last Two Digits of Your ID: To draw the last two digits of your ID ('78'), you need to define the coordinates for the number '78' and use the Mid-point line algorithm to draw the number '78'. The coordinates should be chosen in such a way that they represent the number '78' when connected by lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the Code Work for Any ID: To make the code work for any ID, you need to make the coordinates for drawing the numbers variable instead of fixed. This means that instead of hardcoding the coordinates for the number '78', you should calculate them based on the last two digits of the ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the exact implementation of the code will depend on how you choose to represent the numbers and how you choose to draw the lines. The document provides a general guideline on how to implement the Mid-point line algorithm and how to handle different zones, but the specific details will depend on your implementation."
